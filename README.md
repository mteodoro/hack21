# Sheet Posting at the Edge

One of the most amazing capabilities of Compute@Edge is the power to transform content from anywhere and present it the way you want to. This project marries Javascript, the world’s most popular programming language, with (arguably) the world’s most popular database: Google Sheets!

The result: a Compute@Edge port of www.sheet-posting.me, a blog platform where updating content is as easy as adding a row to a spreadsheet. It updates automatically and even supports Markdown!
